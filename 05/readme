For displaying the matrix A simply remove the semicolum in the runme file.

To run the simulation with Nx = Ny = 15

>> Nx=15; Ny=15; display = true; runme

this operation should be performed for each Nx, Ny.

The results of the computations will be the errors, the running time, the display of the surface and the countour plot.

The Gauss-Seidel results to have a O(dt^2) accurancy.
