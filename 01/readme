Assignment 1

The runme.m file allows the user to run and visualize the results and plots.
This procedure outputs the results (the errors at different dt steps) in the form of the table presented on the last page of the assigment; It also plots the values of the function using the three differents approximation methods (Euler, Heun and Runge-Kutta). 
Furthermore, the behaviour of the errors depending on the dimension of dt is plotted as well.
